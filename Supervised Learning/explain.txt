1. This graph do not looks like the target,because the training process just 20 which is not enough for 967 tile. Most of the tile have not been visited yet which means the value is 0. however, I have some peaks and valleys after 20 training, because we have some visited tile in f20. I have 5 peaks and 4 valleys.These peaks and valleys are caused by visited states. for peaks i got(0.05,2)(0.05,1)(0.025,1)(0.01,0.5)(0.015,0.5). for valleys i got(-0.1,1)(-0.9,0.5)(-0.1,1)(-0.05,1). (high,width)

2. if from 11*11 tiles for each tiling becomes 11*21, which means we will have more tiles need to explore.so after 20 examples, there will have more tiles with 0 than 11*11 situation.
